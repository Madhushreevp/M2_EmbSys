An anti-lock braking system (ABS) is a safety system that allows the wheels on a motor vehicle to continue interacting with the road surface as directed by driver inputs while braking, thus preventing the wheels from locking up and avoid skidding.
An ABS generally offers improved vehicle control and decreases stopping distances on dry and slippery surfaces for many drivers.
The microcontroller is used to compare speed sensor data, control brake cylinder pressure and control the return pump for each wheel brake cylinder. 
The MCU is also responsible for diagnostics, warning notification and communication with other on board control units.

Digital alarm clock works in the same way as your digital watches and mobile phone alarms works.
When you first run the program you have to set the clock time same like the digital clock.
Once you set the clock time it will start running for ever unless you reset the microcontroller. 
Now when ever you want to set an alarm press the button located in 4×3 keypad. 
Pressing the button will lead to an event which displays messages on 16×2 lcd to set hours and minutes. 
Now set alarm time.
Buzzer will be triggered once the alarm time is reached.
