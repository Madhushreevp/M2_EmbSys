Generally, the embedded systems are explained as the collection of hardware and soft- ware components. But just saying this is not the proper explanation of embedded sys- tems. Because it is the system with hardware devices, software integration, and all those embedded together to perform the specified task. There are several purposes and work for developing the embedded system.This paper revolves around one such project which is based on use of embedded systems.The professions relating to construction, such as architecture, surveying, carpentry, masonry, locksmiths, etc require a very im- portant system which can calculate distance and proximity between an object and a tar- get. This distance can be in form of height, sorting, diameter, positioning, dimensioning and many more. One such application where distance needs to be calculated is of ob- ject detection system. In this, objects can be detected for security, counting, inventory or robotic obstacle avoidance. A sensor which can be used for farness determination is ultrasonic sensor. Thus, in this project we calculate distance using ultrasonic sensor and a micro-controller.
