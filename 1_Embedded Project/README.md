# Farness Determination System
> The professions relating to construction, such as architecture, surveying, carpentry, masonry, locksmiths, etc require a very important system which can calculate distance and proximities between an object and a target. This distance can be in form of height, sorting, diameter, positioning, dimensioning and many more. One such application where distance needs to be calculated is of object detection system. In this, objects can be detected for security, counting, inventory or robotic obstacle avoidance. A sensor which can be used for farness determination is ultrasonic sensor. Thus, in this project we calculate distance using ultrasonic sensor and a microcontroller.

## Introduction
Over time, technology has gone through an evolution phase and hence has changed our living style significantly. In today’s era, most people prefer using the latest technologically advanced gadgets to perform their daily life activities. The drastic improvements in the world of technology have undoubtedly made life more convenient and enjoyable. Surely, you must have observed that the latest technological innovations have brought comfort to not only our standard of living but also in the ways we carry out business routine tasks.

## Motivation
Technology also allows doing business easier. Back in the days when we had to do things manually, doing business was harder as you had to capture data and other documents manually. And when you need to review the information you need, you’d still have to go over a pile of physical files. This eats so much time and effort before.These technologies include different types of embedded systems, operating systems and processing units.Embedded System has become an integral part of human lives though they are designed to function with minimal or no human interference. Aspects like low cost, compressed size, and simple design make them very popular. These systems, today, play a vital role in many devices, equipment instrumentation and home appliances and is likely to continue in the recent future.

## Aims & Objectives
Generally, the embedded systems are explained as the collection of hardware and software components. But just saying this is not the proper explanation of embedded systems. Because it is the system with hardware devices, software integration, and all those embedded together to perform the specified task. There are several purposes and work for developing the embedded system.This paper revolves around one such project which is based on use of embedded systems.The professions relating to construction, such as architecture, surveying, carpentry, masonry, locksmiths, etc require a very important system which can calculate distance and proximity between an object and a target. This distance can be in form of height, sorting, diameter, positioning, dimensioning and many more. One such application where distance needs to be calculated is of object detection system. In this, objects can be detected for security, counting, inventory or robotic obstacle avoidance. A sensor which can be used for farness determination is ultrasonic sensor. Thus, in this project we calculate distance using ultrasonic sensor and a micro-controller.

## Research
There are many components used in this project while designing the system.Prior to design of any system a thorough analysis and study is required for accurate outcome of project. The primary goal of the research is to guide action, gather evidence for theories, and contribute to the growth of knowledge in data analysis.The research is important in business decision-making because it can assist in making better decisions when combined with their experience and intuition.Analysis is the process of analyzing data in various formats. Even though data is abundant nowadays, it’s available in different forms and scattered over various sources.The analysis helps to clean and transform all this data into a consistent form so it can be effectively studied. One such method of research is SWOT Analysis.A SWOT analysis is an incredibly simple, yet powerful tool to help develop a project.SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.
