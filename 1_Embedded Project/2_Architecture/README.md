The work flow represents the checking and verification while calculating the distance. This verification can be understood by use of flowchart.If the wave is reflected back then calculate the distance and display it on the LCD display.If the wave does not reflect back then go in loop and wait until it is reflected back.The work flow represents the displaying of the distance. This process can be under- stood by use of flowchart.If the distance is in centimeters then convert it into inches and display it on the LCD display.If it is not in inches then go in loop and wait until it is converted into inches.The work flow represents the block diagram of the overall system.It takes sound signal pulse as input,processes it with help of micro-controller and displays the distance between target and the object on the LCD Display. The fixed power supply is required for powering up of the micro-controller and the switch is for controlling on off for the system.
